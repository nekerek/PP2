# Create and print a dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

# Dictionary Items
# Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and do not allow duplicates.
# Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

# Using the dict() method to make a dictionary:
thisdict = dict(name = "John", age = 36, country = "Norway")
print(thisdict)

# Get a list of the keys:
x = thisdict.keys()

# Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.keys()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "white"
print(x) #after the change

# Get a list of the values:
x = thisdict.values()

# Get a list of the key:value pairs
x = thisdict.items()

# The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)

# You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:
for x in thisdict.values():
  print(x)

# You can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:
for x in thisdict.keys():
  print(x)

# Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:
for x, y in thisdict.items():
  print(x, y)

# Create a dictionary that contain three dictionaries:
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}

# Loop through the keys and values of all nested dictionaries:
for x, obj in myfamily.items():
  print(x)

  for y in obj:
    print(y + ':', obj[y])
